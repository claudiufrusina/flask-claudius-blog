# flask-claudius-blog
My first project written in python using Flask framework.

For the first time during the setup you should run the command: pip install -r requirements.txt 
This command will download the dependencies.
Then add a .env file in where you have to put the parameter called SECRET_KEY= a hash key
Finally for running the app the Visual Studio Debug or from cmd launch : Flask run
